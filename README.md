# JEERS_Final_Project



## Presentation

Add Screenshots or link to our Google Slides presentation.

### Select Topic

The JEERS group selected to work with the UFC Fighter Data. The Dataset encompasses numerous fighter statistics per match, per player.

### Reason

The reason the group chose this dataset is not only because group are UFC enthusiast, they also found the dataset appealing as it contains majorily numerical values. The JEERS group believes there lies plenty of functionality within the dataset and is eager to drive some of these values through machine learning methods to obtain solutions that can answer business questions.
 
### Description

The group will use an all time UFC fight history dataset and machine learning to help determine or predict a future winner in UFC match ups. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com.

### Questions Data Set Will Answer

Using machine learning algorithms, specifically using Random Forest, can a fight winner be determined based on fighter demographics: weight, weightclass, height, age, reach, stance, previous fight record, fight style and fight statistics.


## Technology Used in Project

- Github
- PostgreSQL
- Python / Machine Learning
- Google Docs
- Tableau
- AWS

## Communication

In order to avoid any ambiguity during the process of the project, the JEERS group will meet a minimum of two days a week on Zoom while maintaing a clear line of communication via Slack, text and Google Drive. 
The team will assign roles to each member to maximize productivity and mitigate mistakes. Each team member will create their own branch to work independently from the main branch and will only merge their branches once they have tested that their segment of the project is functional and integrates seamlessly with the main branch.
