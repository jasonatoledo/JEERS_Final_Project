### Select Topic

The JEERS group selected to work with the UFC Fighter Data. The Dataset encompasses a number of different statistics per match, per player.

### Reason

The reason the group chose this dataset is because not only are the member of JEERS group UFC enthusiast, they also found the dataset appealing as it contains multiple numerical values. The JEERS group believes there lies plenty of functionality within the dataset and is eager to drive some of these values through machine learning methods to find specific outcomes.
 
### Description

We will use all time UFC fight history and machine learning to help determine or predict a future winner in UFC match ups.

### Questions Data Set Will Answer

Can we use machine learning to determine a fight winner based on fighter demographics: Weight, Weightclass, Height, Age, Reach, Stance, Previous Fight Record, Fight Style and fight statistics.
